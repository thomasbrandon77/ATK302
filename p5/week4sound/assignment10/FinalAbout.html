        <h2> About The Artist: </h2>

				<div id="AboutMeFont">
			<p>I am from the southern suburbs of Chicago and have been studying Audio Engineering for 5 years. I've taken a lot of Sound Design courses to help myself become well-versed with the phonics of sound. I played trumpet for 6 years and have been singing since I was 5 years old. I am currently a Senior at Illinois State University and am in progress to get a bachelors degree in Creative Technology with an emphasis in Music and Sound Design. I have been working with industry the standard DAW Logic Pro X and have multiple singles, originals, and covers of songs out on my social media sites. I also have worked with many other artists engineering their work as well. I have mixed all different types of genres of music including rap, hip-hop, country, alternative, indie and many others. I have full videos of a lot of these songs too on my YouTube account. Any questions you have about me or any work I've done in general can be asked through the <span class="boldcontact"> contact</span> page. </p>
